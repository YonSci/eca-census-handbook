## Recommendations

- To model large datasets, a suitable processing environment is needed. The recommended hardware specifications for modelling population estimates are at least 500GB of storage capacity, 64GB of RAM and 3.80GHz of processing speed.

- The recommended software for population modelling are R and QGIS. Alternative software such as Python or ArcGIS can be used in the process and support for users of these software packages can be offered however most of the guidance is built around R for statistical processing, and QGIS as an open source GIS solution.

- To spatially model population estimates, a strong knowledge of geospatial information systems (GIS) is recommended. Modellers should understand key GIS techniques.
