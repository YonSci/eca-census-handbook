## Introduction

Funding for population and Housing censuses is the responsibility of government. The census implementing agency should present an activity-based budget to the government for consideration. All census processes including planning, cartographic mapping, enumeration, data processing, analysis and dissemination should be budgeted for in time and a resource mobilization plan put in place. Funding constraints can cause postponements or even cancellations of a census. Additionally, securing partial funds or securing funds too late into the census preparations can push countries to compromise their data collection, data processing and dissemination of census results.

Procurement is an important component to successfully implementing a census. Census procurement planning involves assessing and projecting the procurement needs of a census operation.

### Comparison of procurement and financial management in the non-digital versus digital census era

The transition from manual, paper-based censuses to digital methodologies in Africa has profoundly reshaped the landscapes of procurement and financial management, it introduces new complexities and costs. The procurement process in the non-digital census era was centered on tangible, non-reusable goods, NSOs faced the task of sourcing extensive printing contracts, purchasing or leasing vehicles to transport materials and personnel to every corner of the country, millions of pens, clipboards, satchels, and other materials for enumerators among others. Procurement processes were often lengthy and bureaucratic, focused on securing the best price for bulk physical goods. The digital era led to the adoption of modern procurement tools like e-procurement platforms to enhance transparency and efficiency. It has opened avenues for innovative cost-saving measures, such as the South-South cooperation seen when Kenya donated tablets to other African nations for their census activities.

Financial management has evolved from managing a massive, temporary workforce and physical supply chain to overseeing large-scale technological investments and dynamic, real-time operations. The financial profile of a digital census emphasizes upfront capital investment and offering new tools for real-time financial monitoring over digital dashboards. Budgets now must new cost centres that account for software licensing, data transmission fees, cybersecurity measures, and extensive technical training for staff.

### Considerations for procurement and financial management in a digital census

Ensure fairness in the procurement process, it should be free from favoritism, self-interest or preference in judgment and give timely information that is made known simultaneously to all interested parties. The UN P&R rev 4 provides detailed guidance on procurement management, see para 2.226 to 2.232. The procurement planning process should consider the following:

- Have logistical coordination with multiple census activities and counterparts to reduce the risk of encountering problems that may lead to additional costs and delays.

- Have the essential components in procurement planning such as needs assessment, cost estimation and requirement done as the first steps in the procurement process.

- Apply the principle of best value for money, i.e., get the best mixture of technical and financial attributes that create balance between price and performance for efficiency.

- Promote effective competition as a means of ensuring fairness, integrity, transparency and achieving best value for money by developing a procurement strategy, conducting market research of suppliers, applying national procurement regulations, and using formal methods of solicitation.

Based on experience in the 2020 census round, below are some issues that should be considered in ensuring good financial management for a digital census:

- Countries should have a high-level census steering committee and one of the main roles in their terms of reference should be resource mobilization to secure comprehensive financial support for census funding.

- There should be more international donors and private sector involvement in trying to fill a financial gap and obtain technical cooperation and assistance. The required funding conditions should be known prior to avoid delays and any inconveniences.

- Utilize cost effective approaches to reduce costs without compromising the quality of data. Recent advances in technology can go a long way in achieving cost reductions, therefore cost- benefit analysis should be utilized during the budgeting process. For example, weighing the cost of purchasing new devices vis a vie leasing out.

- Budget development should utilize information on expenditures from the previous census that should be reviewed and adjusted accordingly. As well as ensuring transparent accounting procedures and financial management electronic systems are in place, given that a clean financial audit report adds credibility and acceptance to the census process and results. Leveraging digital financial services is key to efficient and transparent financial management.

- The census budget should be reviewed, and its performance evaluated against the planned phases. Expenditure should be well documented to ensure that all operations are within the budget and there is efficiency and effectiveness in implementation.

Detailed guidelines for census financial management refer to the UN P&R rev 4 para 2.87 to 2.108.
