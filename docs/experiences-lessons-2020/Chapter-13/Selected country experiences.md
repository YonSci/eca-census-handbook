## Selected country experiences

**Tanzania** conducted its 2022 PHC with extensive procurement needs, managed in accordance with government procedures. All procurement activities were authorised by the central census committee and the National Advisory Committee. Financial management was handled within the NSO, following government financial guidelines. The government continued to pay salaries for all officials involved in census operations throughout the implementation period, ensuring consistent support and oversight.

**Kenya** appointed a procurement sub-committee a year before the 2019 census enumeration to oversee all procurement activities. This team developed guidelines aligned with the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act (PPADA, 2015), ensuring compliance throughout the process. Open tendering was the primary method used, and procurement plans were approved annually by the board. While most procurement was centralised, exceptions were made for county-level acquisitions, when necessary, with oversight from the sub-committee. Coordination between procurement and technology/data management teams ensured smooth operations, with regular meetings and status reports enhancing monitoring. Stakeholder engagement, particularly with the Ministry of Information, Communications and Technology (ICT), helped mitigate risks, especially in acquiring mobile devices. Disposal of these devices required careful data removal due to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) data security concerns.

Kenya also established a financial management sub-committee within the census Technical Working Committee (TWC) to mobilise and manage resources, primarily sourced from the government. Funds were centrally managed through a dedicated KNBS bank account, with county-level accounts opened for local transactions. Regulations were shared with officers handling funds, and all payments were supported by authorised documentation. Activities such as allowances, venue rentals, material storage, and transportation were funded through these accounts. Post-census, accounting documents-including payment schedules, attendance registers, and meeting minutes—were submitted to both the central finance office and county accountants to ensure transparency and accountability.
