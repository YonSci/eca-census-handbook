## Key implementation areas for advocacy, publicity and resource mobilization in a digital census

The following strategic issues need to be addressed when implementing advocacy, publicity and resource mobilization in a digital census:

- A separate document outlining the strategic plan for communication, publicity and advocacy should be developed. The strategic document should contain a list of stakeholders; target communication channels/media to be used; implementation plan for the various activities; collaborations; required resources; budget for the implementation; a monitoring and evaluation plan.

- A stand-alone resource mobilization strategy should be developed in a consultative manner during the planning phase and followed through.

- Conduct briefings on key census findings relevant to the Civil society organizationsâ€™ constituencies to support advocacy and program development.

- Integrate training of the mass media with the overall census public relations and advocacy work because they can carry the message to a wide audience. Include schools - both students and teachers as well as geographers.

- The proposed courses or materials for enhancing promotion of, and training in, the use of statistical data should be fully integrated into the overall census advocacy or training programme.
