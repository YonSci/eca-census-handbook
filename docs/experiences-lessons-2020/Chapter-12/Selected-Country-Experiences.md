## Selected country experiences

**Gambia** Bureau of Statistics (GBoS) did not have a designated communication and publicity unit, GBOS engaged with the National Population Commission from the start of the census planning. It therefore utilized the existing governance structures, expertise and technical skills in communication.

**Zimbabwe** Bureau of statistics (ZimStat) initially thought they do not need a census communication and publicity officer, and this was not factored in the plan. However, ZimStat leveraged on [partnership and collaboration](file:///C:/Users/ymersha/Downloads/e-cencus-handbook/Chapter12%20Advocacy-to%20upload.docx#_Selected_country_experiences) with the government communication ministry to have an effective census communication and publicity.

In **Uganda** a publicity and communication strategy was developed at time of planning. This enabled bringing various stakeholders on board to support the census. 

**Sierra Leone** undertook a comprehensive and inclusive approach to build public trust during its Mid-Term Census. Multiple stakeholders were engaged, including civil society organizations (CSOs), parliamentary committees, political parties, and local leaders such as mayors, youth groups, and paramount chiefs. Publicity efforts were intensified through media partnerships, town hall meetings, and digital campaigns. Key messages emphasized the benefits of the census, legal obligations, and the risks of non-participation. Communication tools included radio and TV simulcasts, social media, printed materials, toll-free helplines, and community outreach via town criers and loudspeaker vehicles. Special attention was given to resistant communities with tailored messaging to encourage participation.

**Kenya** implemented a strategic publicity and advocacy plan for its 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census (KPHC), engaging a communications firm to manage the campaign. The plan segmented target audiences—ranging from the general public to special groups like nomads—and tailored messages to each. Activities included media briefings, production of IEC materials, training census personnel, and extensive use of television, radio, and social media. Roadshows in local languages and partnerships with educational institutions helped spread awareness. A call center and bulk SMS platform were established for public inquiries, and a dedicated hashtag, #KenyaCensus2019, was used to centralize online communication. A web portal and branded email signatures further supported the campaign.

**Namibia** provided a valuable insight during a central meeting where regional statisticians shared their experience of engaging with neighborhood watch schemes and farmers during data collection. This grassroots approach was recommended for adoption in other regions to enhance community engagement and data accuracy.
