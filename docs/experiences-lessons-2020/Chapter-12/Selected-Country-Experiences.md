## Selected country experiences

**Gambia** Bureau of Statistics (GBoS) did not have a designated communication and publicity unit, GBoS engaged with the National Population Commission from the start of the census planning. It therefore utilised the existing governance structures, expertise and technical skills in communication.

**Zimbabwe** Bureau of statistics (ZIMSTAT) initially thought they do not need a census communication and publicity officer, and this was not factored in the plan. However, ZIMSTAT leveraged on [partnership and collaboration](file:///C:/Users/ymersha/Downloads/e-cencus-handbook/Chapter12%20Advocacy-to%20upload.docx#_Selected_country_experiences) with the government communication ministry to have an effective census communication and publicity.

In **Uganda**, a publicity and communication strategy was developed at the time of planning. This enabled bringing various stakeholders on board to support the census. 

**Sierra Leone** undertook a comprehensive and inclusive approach to build public trust during its mid-term census. Multiple stakeholders were engaged, including civil society organisations (CSOs), parliamentary committees, political parties, and local leaders such as mayors, youth groups, and paramount chiefs. Publicity efforts were intensified through media partnerships, town hall meetings, and digital campaigns. Key messages emphasised the benefits of the census, legal obligations, and the risks of non-participation. Communication tools included radio and TV simulcasts, social media, printed materials, toll-free helplines, and community outreach via town criers and loudspeaker vehicles. Special attention was given to resistant communities with tailored messaging to encourage participation.

**Kenya** implemented a strategic publicity and advocacy plan for its 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census (KPHC), engaging a communications firm to manage the campaign. The plan segmented target audiences—ranging from the general public, to special groups like nomads—and tailored messages to each. Activities included media briefings, production of Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) materials, training census personnel, and extensive use of television, radio, and social media. Roadshows in local languages and partnerships with educational institutions helped spread awareness. A call centre and bulk SMS platform were established for public inquiries, and a dedicated hashtag, #KenyaCensus2019, was used to centralise online communication. A web portal and branded email signatures further supported the campaign.

**Namibia** provided a valuable insight during a central meeting where regional statisticians shared their experience of engaging with neighborhood watch schemes and farmers during data collection. This grassroots approach was recommended for adoption in other regions to enhance community engagement and data accuracy.

**Tanzania** conducted the 2022 Population and Housing Census (PHC) with a strong emphasis on nationwide publicity and advocacy. The campaign, branded with the slogan “SENSA KWA MAENDELEO: JIANDAE KUHESABIWA” (“Census for Development: Prepare to be Counted”) was supported by two Census Commissioners and guided by standardised publicity guidelines. A month before enumeration, the “SENSABIKA” campaign was launched, reaching millions via SMS and social media. Presidential involvement was key—President Samia Suluhu Hassan declared the census date, launched the logo, and addressed the nation on census night. Fireworks events and early enumeration of national leaders helped boost public engagement. The government funded 97% of the census, with the remainder supported by development partners.
