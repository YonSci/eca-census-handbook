## Selected Country Experiences

Kenyaâ€™s 2019 census demonstrated the benefits and challenges of digital enumeration. Enumerators used tablets to collect and transmit data, supported by real-time dashboards and supervisory checks. However, issues such as device malfunctions and network instability highlighted the need for robust technical support and contingency planning.

South Africa adopted a multi-modal approach, combining CAPI, CAWI, and CATI. The flexibility of this model allowed for broader participation, especially through CAWI, which was promoted as a quick and data-free option for respondents. The success of CAWI in South Africa underscores the importance of public awareness and user-friendly digital platforms.

In Sierra Leone, the use of GIS tools and cloud-based systems enabled efficient data collection and transmission. Local mobile providers played a key role in ensuring connectivity, and the integration of mapping tools improved the accuracy of enumeration.

Botswana faced challenges related to device procurement and network coverage. The use of multiple tablet models led to inconsistencies in performance, particularly in GPS functionality and battery life. These issues affected data quality and highlighted the importance of adhering to tested specifications during procurement.
