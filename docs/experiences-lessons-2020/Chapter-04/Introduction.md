## Introduction

The 2020 round of Population and Housing Censuses (PHC) in Africa marked a pivotal shift from traditional paper-based enumeration to digital methods. This transition brought significant improvements in data quality, timeliness, and operational efficiency. However, it also introduced new challenges, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, training, data security, and system integration. This chapter explores the evolution of data capture, transmission, and management in the digital era, drawing on practical experiences from countries that implemented digital censuses.

### A comparison of data capture, transmission and management in the non-digital versus digital census era

In the non-digital era, census data was collected using paper questionnaires. Enumerators manually recorded responses, which were then physically transported to central processing centers. Data entry was labor-intensive and prone to errors, and the entire process—from collection to dissemination—could take many months. Security concerns were also heightened due to the physical movement and storage of sensitive documents. Fragile documents were at risk of damage during transport, while manual data entry often caused delays and inaccuracies.  
   
In contrast, digital censuses utilize electronic devices such as tablets and smartphones to capture data directly in the field. This approach eliminates the need for manual data entry and allows for real-time validation and transmission. The integration of GIS tools and dashboards enables more effective monitoring and quality control. While digital methods streamline operations and reduce processing time, they require robust ICT infrastructure and careful planning to ensure data integrity and security.

### Considerations for data capture, transmission and management in a digital census

Transitioning to a digital census requires a series of strategic decisions. One of the first considerations is the choice of data collection devices. Some countries opted to purchase tablets, while others borrowed or implemented bring-your-own-device (BYOD) schemes. Each approach has cost and logistical implications, particularly in terms of device standardization and maintenance.  
   
In the 2020 round, according to the survey completed at the 2024 Expert Group Meeting of African Census Managers the majority (83%) of census implementing agencies bought hand-held devices. However, some agencies (9%) were able to borrow devices and the remainder used a mixture of buying and borrowing devices.  For countries that responded to the survey, on average just over half the costs were spent on the field enumeration, including field hardware and software, field staff pay and training. Therefore, borrowing devices or implementing use-your-own-device schemes which some countries trialed could be an innovative way to reduce census costs. Note that if the field officers use their own devices, there can be financial benefits, but security and confidentiality must be prioritized. Additionally, any technology adopted must be thoroughly tested during the various testing phases, for necessary adjustments to be made prior to the main census.

 Another key decision involves the enumeration method. Countries must determine whether to use Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI), Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI), Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI), or a combination of these. The choice depends on factors such as internet coverage, population digital literacy, and the complexity of the questionnaire.  
   
Connectivity is another critical factor. In areas with limited or unreliable internet access, alternative transmission methods such as Bluetooth syncing between enumerators and supervisors must be considered. Data security must also be prioritized, with encryption, access controls, and secure storage solutions forming part of the overall ICT strategy.
