## Challenges and Lessons Learnt

- Several common challenges emerged across countries. Device-related issues, such as hardware failures and inconsistent specifications, disrupted field operations. Inadequate network coverage hindered real-time data transmission, especially in remote areas. Training gaps among field staff limited their ability to troubleshoot technical problems, and in some cases, data quality suffered due to insufficient supervisory checks.

- Security concerns also surfaced. In Kenya, the late introduction of Mobile Device Management (MDM) software meant that some devices were vulnerable to unauthorized access or interference. These experiences underscore the need for early planning and comprehensive training in both technical and operational aspects of digital census implementation.
