## Selected country experiences

**Kenya** produced a wide range of census products from the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census (KPHC), including preliminary and basic volumes, thematic and analytical reports, and various visual and digital outputs like posters, brochures, and a census atlas. Thematic reports covered topics such as fertility, mortality, migration, urbanisation, gender, disability, youth, education, housing, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and more. The process involved a technical team, tabulation plans, data consistency checks, and stakeholder validation. Dissemination was guided by a policy and included public launches, media forums, digital platforms, and engagement with stakeholders, though resource limitations affected outreach to lower administrative levels.

**Ghana** released several volumes from its 2021 Population and Housing Census (PHC), starting with a preliminary report and followed by thematic and analytical reports, a census atlas, and plans for interactive dashboards and infographics. Dissemination strategies emphasised sustained engagement, user-friendly presentations, and capacity building. Activities included stakeholder interviews, media engagement, webinars, and educational programs. Ghana also planned initiatives like a statistics-for-schools program and an annual census awareness day to maintain public interest and promote data use.

**Malawi** conducted its digital census in 2018 and produced a variety of print and digital products, including district and thematic reports, media briefs, and infographics. The Malawi Data Dissemination Platform (MDDP) played a key role in making data accessible and interactive. The dissemination plan was integrated into a broader communication strategy, using mass communication, interpersonal engagement, and partnerships. Challenges included unplanned costs for communication experts. Malawi also developed monitoring, evaluation, and crisis recovery plans to support the census process.

**Mozambique** produced a range of outputs from its 2017 census, including preliminary and final reports, brochures, projections, shapefiles, and child-friendly materials like comics. Dissemination was tailored to different user groups, such as students, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), media, and people with disabilities. The approach emphasised inclusive communication and partnerships, including a media association and WhatsApp groups. The use of consultants for thematic studies posed challenges, but media engagement significantly increased public interest and data usage.

**Eswatini** faced delays in producing thematic reports due to staffing shortages, despite support from UNFPA. The 2017 census outputs included thematic reports and population projections, disseminated through stakeholder workshops and digital formats. Subject specialists from various sectors contributed to the reports. The country has maintained a 10-year census cycle since 1956, with efforts to ensure timely and accessible dissemination through both print and electronic means.

**Tanzania** launched its initial 2022 census results 45 days after enumeration, accompanied by a National Guideline for Utilisation of Census Results. Dissemination used traditional and digital media, mobile apps, and public events. Reports were developed collaboratively by government staff, academics, and interns. Plans included contracting university experts for monographs and building staff capacity. The strategy aimed to ensure broad access and use of census data for planning and development.

**Egypt** published its 2017 census results via a platform on the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS) website, including a geoportal for GIS data. Dissemination tools included hard and soft copies, press releases, and workshops. CAPMAS prioritised electronic publication of preliminary results and used Google Analytics to monitor user engagement. The agency maintained a schedule of publications and emphasised timely data updates.

**Zimbabwe** released eight preliminary reports from its 2022 census to support budget planning and constituency delimitation. Dissemination included hybrid workshops, cabinet presentations, social media, and media interviews in local languages. Products included national and provincial reports, thematic reports, and a census atlas. Future dissemination plans involve posters, seminars, and integration into REDATAM for user-generated analysis. Partnerships with media aim to enhance public understanding and access to census data.
