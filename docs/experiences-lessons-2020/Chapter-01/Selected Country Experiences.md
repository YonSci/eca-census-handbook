## Selected Country Experiences

**Kenya** began its census planning in 2015, four years ahead of the 2019 census. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) developed a comprehensive proposal covering all census phases, which underwent extensive revisions with input from experts and stakeholders. The finalized proposal was approved in 2017, followed by a cabinet memo and legal gazettement in 2018, providing constitutional and legal backing. Budgeting involved subject matter specialists drafting individual budgets, which were consolidated and refined through stakeholder consultations before cabinet approval. Implementation was coordinated through various committees, including the National Census Steering Committee and County Census Committees, with roles and responsibilities clearly defined in legal notices and circulars.

**Namibia** focused on cost-effective strategies for its census, such as borrowing tablets and using government vehicles. Planning included a phased approach to mapping and extensive stakeholder engagement, including regional workshops and consultations with ministries and partners. The Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) led the process, submitting proposals to the Cabinet Committee on Treasury and briefing the President. The budget, developed internally, was presented to donors and revised multiple times due to funding gaps. Major cost drivers included mapping, technology, and personnel. A detailed census structure was established, with national and regional committees and subcommittees handling various aspects like logistics, advocacy, and data processing.

**Tanzania** initiated its 2022 Population and Housing Census (PHC) planning in 2019 with the creation of a strategic handbook outlining resource mobilization and operational timelines. The handbook, developed by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), was reviewed by stakeholders and launched by the Prime Minister in 2021. Legal backing was provided through gazettement under the Statistics Act. The budget was primarily government-funded (97%), with some donor contributions in equipment. A decision to combine the PHC with the Building Census and Addressing Exercise led to budget revisions. Implementation was managed through national, regional, and district committees, including a Central Census Committee co-chaired by top government officials, and technical advisory groups for expert input.

**Sierra Leone** adopted an inclusive approach to census planning, learning from past experiences to ensure a more efficient and responsive process aligned with national and sustainable development goals. Legal authority was established through the NSO Operations Act and a presidential proclamation. The budget and planning emphasized national ownership and coordination. Implementation was supported by a Census Advisory Committee and a Census Secretariat with regional offices. Technical aspects were managed by a committee comprising government, academia, and development partners. Public engagement was handled by a dedicated communication committee. Technical support was outsourced to international organizations like UNFPA and the World Bank, covering areas such as quality control, data processing, and dissemination.
