## Selected Country Experiences

**Kenya** implemented a highly automated and streamlined census process in 2019, minimising human interaction through the use of mobile devices and a self-contained network that did not require internet connectivity. The enumeration was conducted using a de facto approach, counting individuals based on their location on the census reference night. Special populations such as travelers, prisoners, and hospital inpatients were enumerated using short or hybrid questionnaires, often by personnel from those institutions. Data was transmitted to a central server, or via Bluetooth when internet access was unavailable. Pre-enumeration involved listing households and assigning unique structure and household numbers, which were marked visibly on buildings. Enumerators used both digital and hard copy maps to identify enumeration areas, with urban areas relying more on hard copies due to file size and clarity issues.

The logistics of the census were extensive, involving thousands of vehicles, including boats and helicopters, to reach remote areas. Materials such as tablets, power banks, and identification badges were centrally procured and distributed through a detailed delivery plan. Local universities assembled the mobile devices, which were stored in secure facilities guarded by police. The return of materials followed a structured process, with devices logged into a database for future use. The logistics team, including coordinators and casual workers, managed the entire operation from preparation to the return of equipment.

**South Africa** conducted its 2022 census using a fully digital, de facto approach, offering three modes of participation: face-to-face interviews (CAPI), online self-enumeration (CAWI), and telephone interviews (CATI). This multi-modal strategy allowed flexibility and increased accessibility, especially for populations in transit or in institutions. The CAWI method gained popularity as users found it quick and easy, prompting a surge in registrations. The online form was accessible via smartphones or computers and was data-free for the user, making it more inclusive. The census emphasised user convenience and efficiency, with the process taking between ten to forty-five minutes depending on household size.

**Tanzania** faced the challenge of provisioning 205,000 tablets for its 2022 census. To address this, the country developed a custom provisioning tool using open-source technology, which significantly improved efficiency by automating software installation, security settings, and data collection. This system allowed each workstation to provide ten tablets in two minutes, saving 90% of person-hours compared to other methods. The logistics committee, formed from various government bodies, managed the distribution and return of equipment. Transportation was handled by government and private entities, including a logistics company that volunteered its services. Around 1,800 vehicles, along with boats, motorcycles, and helicopters, were used to reach all areas. Materials transported included training manuals, power banks, identification badges, and publicity materials, ensuring comprehensive support for the census operation.
