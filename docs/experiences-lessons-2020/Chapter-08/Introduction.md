## Introduction

The enumeration phase is among the most important stages for a population and housing census that happens after several years of preparatory activities. The main objective of enumeration is to ensure that all individuals are covered and enumerated only once to achieve a proper description of the total population of a country and its geographical distribution within the country. 

Census enumeration is conducted on either a de facto basis (enumerating individuals where they are found on census day regardless of where they normally reside) or de jure basis (enumerating individuals where they normally reside regardless of where they are found on census day) based on a specific reference date. The enumeration takes place over a varying period of days. In the 2020 round, according to the survey completed at the 2024 Expert Group Meeting of African Census Managers, the number of days planned for enumeration ranged from 7 to 50, with an average of 19 days. However, no country managed to complete their enumeration in the time originally planned, with the average number of 11 additional days being required to complete the enumeration. 

A census relies on successful enumeration within a strict time-bound period. To achieve this requires robust logistics planning for effective implementation of all the processes. Census logistics broadly entails procurement of equipment and materials, provision of devices, transportation, and storage. During procurement, the process of acquisition and storage of the census equipment and materials needs to be planned effectively. 
This chapter focuses on the areas of provisioning of tablets, pre-enumeration listing of households, EA identification, and census data collection.


### Enumeration and logistics during the non-digital vs digital era

In the digital era, the traditional method of enumerating the population through face-to-face interviews is done using handheld devices (CAPI) or by self-enumeration online (CAWI). See also enumeration instruments. This means that the data is automatically captured electronically as opposed to using a paper questionnaire. In turn this means that the data is ready for monitoring progress of the census in real-time; analysis can be started sooner than in a non-digital census; and thus outputs can be produced in a more timely manner.

However, the use of technology introduces the potential for one central disaster having an impact across the whole enumeration process, which is more devastating than in the non-digital census, where failures are more likely to have localized impacts. In addition, the failure of a significant part of the technology close to census day such as the central server can have a more serious impact and therefore a lot more preparation and testing is required compared to the non-digital census. 

With regard to census logistics, in a traditional census, large quantities of materials such as field gear for cartographic mapping teams, uniforms for the enumeration team - usually t-shirts or reflector jackets, field bags, umbrellas, printing of manuals, questionnaires, etc. must be procured and delivered to the appropriate locations. In a digital census, there is additionally the procurement of ICT equipment like server, tablets and accessories, sim-cards and bundles etc. Mobile devices are usually delicate and need careful handling during storage, provisioning, and transportation to the field and back to the warehouse for decommissioning. During provisioning and decommissioning a spacious warehousing facility with good racking systems for ease of retrieval will be required.  


### Considerations for digital census enumeration and logistics

Countries should develop appropriate enumeration procedures that will ensure that full coverage of the population is attained, within the predetermined budget and set timelines as well as maximizing efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Consider how to achieve the highest response rate and best possible data quality. This will involve publicity campaigns and engagement of local leaders to ensure that they cooperate with the NSO to assist in community acceptance of the census. See also Chapter 13: Publicity and Advocacy.

Consider populations that might be particularly hard to enumerate and how you can reach such populations. Special population groups such as include migrants, nomads, defense forces and persons in restricted areas, homeless persons, diplomats etc may need a specific strategy in place in order to ensure they are included in the census. See P&R  v4 para 3.198 and 3.532.

Also take into consideration the safety of your field staff. If they are working in areas that are hard to reach or are likely to be dangerous, how will you ensure their safety and the security of their equipment?

Consider how best to use dashboards for effective real-time monitoring of the data collections process, and of the quality of the data being collected. This will require effective HQ/coordinator/supervisor/field-staff working arrangements. See also dashboards and data quality monitoring. 

Good training and guidelines for the enumerators are essential so that the data gathered is consistent and of a high quality. See also training. In particular, consider whether the census is de facto or de jura and then give enumerators clear instructions about all possible cases that may create confusion when identifying the correct place of enumeration.  Good training will help to ensure that every individual has only one place of enumeration and thus avoid double counting. There should also be clear guidelines on who should be included or excluded from the enumeration. See Field enumeration, Handbook on the Management of Population and Housing Censuses.

Remember that the enumeration exercise should observe the fundamental principles of official statistics, and specifically should ensure confidentiality of census data among the enumerators. See also data security. Furthermore, the census enumeration procedures should be complied with and remain consistent across all the regions of the country.
With regards to logistics, census implementing agencies should consider collaborating with other government institutions that can support in providing logistics arrangements such as transportation, use of existing infrastructure like school classrooms for training, warehousing services for storage of census materials at both national and sub-national level etc. 
In device provisioning, a key consideration should be to think through what needs to happen to the devices to make them ready for field work. Usually, this will include but is not limited to, installing the CAPI and its runner application, loading the assigned EA maps, loading instruction manuals (usually pdfs) on CAPI and device use installing required applications such as map viewer/navigator, pdf reader, etc. 
Consider which of the core and non-core census activities may need to be contracted out as a way of increasing efficiency where methods and technologies are not available internally. Ensure proper understanding and management of elements that contribute to final data quality and maintain confidentiality when contracting out census activities.
Consider setting up a census logistics committee with responsibility for planning and implementation of all of the logistical activities and process. Census logistics requires timely completion of a census implementation plan and careful linking of the different activities of the census phases. See also census implementation committees.

Early planning for procurement of all the census materials and equipment is key to the success of census implementation.  However, this is also dependent on availability of financial resources. There also need to be plans in place for the secure transportation and storage of the tablets for the enumerators. Consider how many of each item will need to be transported and stored and the availability of suitable secure storage facilities before dispatching equipment to the field.

Finally, consider the processes to be used for documenting the experiences and lessons learned to inform the next round of census. Any major gaps that occurred in the previous census enumeration should be addressed to ensure a relatively higher coverage rate.
