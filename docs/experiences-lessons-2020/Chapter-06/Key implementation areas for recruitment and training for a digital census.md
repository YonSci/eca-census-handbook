## Key implementation areas for recruitment and training for a digital census

### Development of guidelines

Such guidelines should lay out details regarding the recruitment campaign and publicity, selection/vetting criteria, hiring, performance evaluation and payments procedures. See UN P&R, Rev 4, [para. 2.181](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesM/Series_M67Rev4en.pdf#page=123) and [para 2.192](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesM/Series_M67Rev4en.pdf#page=125).

### Development and testing of e-recruitment system

The e-recruitment system for online applications, sifting and grading of tests needs to be thoroughly tested before use. Ensure that the IT experts developing the system are in close communication with the human resources (HR) and census experts in charge of recruitment to make sure that their requirements are met and not misinterpreted. Test your e-recruitment system thoroughly for ease of use by both applicants and recruiters. Bear in mind that when your recruitment campaign goes live there may be millions of applications with peak periods of demand as application deadlines approach. Stress-test your system to ensure that it can handle the expected volume of traffic. 

### Development of integrated systems

Human resource information systems can greatly assist the management of the large temporary workforce of a full field enumeration census. These systems can help streamline and optimise recruitment and deployment of new staff and can help identify personnel with relevant skills who can be cross trained for additional tasks, or for redeployment for other non‐census activities. [(UN P&R, Rev 4, para. 2.211.)](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesM/Series_M67Rev4en.pdf#page=130). Information such as bank details and ID numbers that are needed for human resource purposes can be collected as part of the e-recruitment system to maximise efficiency. 

### Deployment of recruitment advertisement campaign

The recruitment campaign should leverage digital media to maximise coverage. See chapter on [Advocacy, Publicity and Resource Mobilization](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/Chapter-12/Introduction).

### Development of Training programme

The training programme should utilise an online approach for basic generic modules where possible. For example, all enumerators may be required to complete mandatory courses in basic computer skills, general knowledge about the census, data security and data protection, before attending any in-person training. Ensure that there is sufficient time allowed to let enumerators become familiar with the CAPI application, navigation maps, etc. Ideally at least two days field practice should be incorporated into the training programme, covering both urban and rural areas, so that enumerators are not using the devices for the first time when they start enumeration. This means that tablets/smartphones etc. that will be used for enumeration need to be available for training – allow sufficient time for procurement and setting up of the CAPI applications to enable this.

### Pilot of recruitment and training

The [census pilot](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/Chapter-05/Introduction) should include thorough testing of the recruitment and training technology and methodology to ensure that the systems are working as expected. For example, during the pilot, Namibia found that its e-recruitment system was unable to handle the large volumes of applications made. This issue was resolved by the time of the census recruitment.

### Deployment of training programme

Training in census is normally done in a cascaded manner starting with master trainers who are mostly subject area specialists, training of trainers, training of supervisors and lastly training of enumerators. For consistency in the training across the entire country, the training materials should be developed centrally and tested on non-expert users. During the training, it is good practice for trainers to meet at the end of the day to review progress and handle unresolved issues to improve the quality of training. Training centres managed by administrators may be set up in different locations around the country to facilitate in-person training.
