## Selected Country experiences

In Africa, online training generally meant using Zoom or equivalent online meeting facilities to carry out training in a similar manner to classroom-based training. This did not always prove to be successful with concerns that learners were not fully engaged. There is therefore some reluctance to adopt online learning for training census enumerators in African NSOs. However, an alternative method of developing purpose-built on-line training modules that learners can self-study and which include assessments have proved to be successful and provides consistently and scalability. Hence the inclusion of the case study from England and Wales which gives an example of a successful online training model, and which could be adopted by African NSOs wishing to make better use of online training.

In **Tanzania and Zanzibar**, the 2022 Population and Housing Census marked a significant shift with the implementation of a nationwide e-recruitment system. Developed in-house by the Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics and the Office of Chief Government Statistician Zanzibar, the system allowed applicants to register and apply online, offering features like real-time updates, automated shortlisting, and geographic integration. Despite challenges such as limited internet access and digital literacy, the system proved efficient, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable. It reduced administrative workload by 70%, cut costs, and improved transparency. Security measures, user support, and real-time monitoring ensured the integrity and reliability of the recruitment process.

**Namibia** also adopted an e-recruitment system for both pilot and main census operations. Recruitment was conducted at the constituency level, with a preference for local applicants familiar with their communities. The process was advertised widely through various media and public institutions. A key challenge was the requirement for a Grade 12 education, which excluded some candidates in low-literacy areas. Training was conducted in three levels: master training, training of trainers (ToT), and regional training for field staff. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, training sessions were limited to small groups, and daily review sessions were held to address issues and improve training quality.

In **Kenya**, a manual recruitment process was used, guided by a standardized recruitment guideline. Applications were submitted to local administrative offices and shortlisted based on qualifications and legal requirements, including gender balance. The recruitment process was decentralized but standardized through uniform interview tests and centralized approval. Training followed a cascading model, starting with a central Training of Trainers, followed by regional training for ICT and content supervisors, and finally training for enumerators. Training was mostly non-residential, except in arid regions, and was supported with allowances for meals and materials.

**Botswana** utilized e-recruitment for its 2022 census, initially using Google Forms for assessments during the pilot phase. For the main census, a more robust system was developed using CSPro software, allowing offline assessments with online synchronization. The system was secure and required national ID registration. This approach streamlined the recruitment and assessment process, ensuring readiness and reducing logistical burdens.

**Sierra Leone** followed a traditional recruitment model similar to past censuses, with media advertisements and interviews. Digital literacy was an advantage in the selection process. Training included examinations to guide final selection, and extra personnel were recruited as reserves. Contracts and IDs were issued to ensure proper identification and accountability in the field.

**England and Wales** conducted their census during the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating a fully digital training approach. Training was delivered through a Learning Management System (LMS) with interactive e-learning modules and virtual classroom sessions for managers. The training was comprehensive, with 32 modules, assessments, and strict completion timelines. Despite technical and operational challenges, such as LMS integration issues and the need for deadline extensions, the digital model proved effective. It reduced costs, ensured consistent training delivery, and allowed for flexible, self-paced learning. Quality assurance was embedded throughout the process, and the model demonstrated the potential for scalable, high-quality digital training.
