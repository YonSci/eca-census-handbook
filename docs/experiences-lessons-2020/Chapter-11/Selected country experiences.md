## Selected country experiences

**Namibia** in carrying out the mapping exercise, the Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) collaborated with the Ministry of Urban and Rural Development which had an interest in the housing characteristics and conditions as well as the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform which had an interest in water and sanitation statistics. The output from this exercise contributed to the development of a Statistics Business Register and the National Dwelling Unit Frame meant to provide detailed household and land use information for each Dwelling Unit in Namibia. Most of these variables were included based on requests from stakeholders such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Water, and Land Reform, and the Ministry of Urban and Rural Development. Apart from households, buildings such as shops, schools, hospitals, lodges, offices, and other establishments were also covered, and these questions were sourced from the Ministry of Industrialisation, Trade, and Small and Medium Enterprises development in collaboration with the NSA’s Economics department. 

**Zimbabwe** Bureau of statistics (ZIMSTAT) partnered with the government communication ministry and worked through its decentralised structure by creating a census communication and publicity committee at national level that worked with the district committees and included the political audience. This partnership was to address the challenge of lack of census communication and publicity officer. 

**Gambia** Bureau of Statistics (GBoS) also leveraged partnerships to address its challenge of lack of a designated communication and publicity unit by engaging with the National Population Commission for effective census [communication and publicity](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/Chapter-11/Introduction).

**Kenya** and **Tanzania** leveraged partnerships and collaboration for effective logistics management. See chapter on [enumeration and logistics](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/Chapter-08/Introduction)

**Tanzania** contracted experts from the universities to write monographs, through this partnership staff from NBS and OCGS and interns from universities built their skills and capacity. Several countries partnered in the development of census products and there were clear stakeholder roles based on their comparative advantage. The roles and responsibilities were clear at the [planning stage](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/Chapter-11/Introduction) such as:

- The census implementing agency provides technical and management leadership; planning of the census products’ release schedule; data analysis and content production; dissemination as well as data sharing if required.

- Sectoral ministries guide selection of topics, give sectoral expertise; policy analysis; quality assurance, and data utilisation for evidence-based decision-making. NSO to undertake the entire tasks of production of census products in partnership with sectoral ministries; national academic or public research institution lead NSO and sectoral ministries - this could be under an MoU or contracting the services.

- Academia and national researchers provide research capacity, advanced statistical expertise, disciplinary and context-specific knowledge.

- International consultants and research firms provide supplementary capacity for research and analysis, outsourcing recruitment/contract management. NSO outsourcing by subcontracting the entire production of census products either to national or international research institutions and/or consultants.

- Development partners provide resource mobilisation, technical support, operational support, promotion of international standards and best practices, quality assurance, and capacity building at the NSO if required.

- Donors provide funding, prioritisation of topics, and data utilisation for development programs. 

- Donors and development partners also provide resources to hire research institutions or national/international consultant(s) to lead in areas/topics where national capacity is lacking in partnership with NSO and sectoral ministries/national institutions.
