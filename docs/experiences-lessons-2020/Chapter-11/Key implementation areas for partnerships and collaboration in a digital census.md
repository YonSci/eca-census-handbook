## Key implementation areas for partnerships and collaboration in a digital census

Partnerships are a direct response to the primary challenges of conducting a digital census in the African context, so the following should be considered:

- Digital censuses are expensive, requiring investment in hardware, software, and training. Partnerships are crucial for mobilizing **financial resources** to fill funding gaps.

- Many NSOs lack the in-house capacity to develop, deploy, and manage the complex IT infrastructure required, so partnerships and collaboration offset the **technological deficits** that may exist. Mobile network operator partnerships that involve negotiating bulk data contracts with the NSO to ensure seamless data transmission. In some cases, subsidized communication for the census team can be negotiated, which helps enumerators easily contact supervisors for real-time guidance.

- There is often a scarcity of local **experts** in some areas like cybersecurity, geospatial analysis, and large-scale data management, partnerships and collaboration can fill the expertise shortages. Universities and research centers provide intellectual capital and analytical power.

- Procuring and distributing hundreds of thousands of devices, ensuring connectivity, and managing fieldwork across vast and sometimes difficult terrain is a massive undertaking. Partnerships and collaboration can relieve the **logistical complexities**.

- Overcoming public skepticism about data collection, especially digital data, requires credible voices and community engagement that NSOs may struggle to achieve on their own. Partnerships and collaboration can support in building **public trust**.
