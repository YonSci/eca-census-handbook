## Key areas to be piloted in digital census

### Quality of Enumeration Area maps

EAs maps should be digitised and produced with the ideal measure of size (MOS) usually 80–150 households. The census pilot therefore tests the completeness and accuracy of the EA maps especially boundaries, integration of the maps with the CAPI application, inclusion of accurate structure identifiers and addresses. Additionally, this helps to address challenges of using low resolution maps on tablets that are not sufficient to allow for resizing and zooming without alteration by enumerators. Testing the quality of EA maps at the same time informs the finalisation of the tablet specifications to handle all aspects of the digital census. See more about [pilot mapping](docs/experiences-lessons-2020/Chapter-02/Introduction).

### Efficiency of Device Preparation

The pilot census should test the equipment preparedness to ensure; efficiency in blocking the unnecessary applications and websites (e.g., entertainment), prevention of supervisors and enumerators from installing applications, and administrator access to bypass user-created passwords. As well as testing the correct use of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on all tablets; battery timeout vis-a-vis the specifications. In case the tablet battery time out is not satisfactory, National Statistics Offices (NSOs) should make provisions for frequent charging in the field (e.g., power banks, battery packs or solar chargers). This key area also includes testing the readiness and adequacy of the census data centre and related IT infrastructure like servers to ensure data security.

### Effectiveness of CAPI data collection application, data transfer mechanisms, data processing

The pilot census can be used to test the final questionnaire in the way that it should be implemented on the devices for consistency in the flow of the questions, skip patterns, proper implementation of changes from the pretests etc. In terms of data transfer, focus is put on connectivity and communication issues to test the internet network infrastructure and ensure that interviewers and supervisors are familiar with data transfer procedures. This evaluation area is also aimed to ensure that all supervisors can provide the necessary support to their teams in the event of a technical failure in the field. For data processing, test the data coding, tabulation and analysis plans using the data collected from the pilot.

### Evaluate the data quality monitoring system and dashboard

A digital census utilises electronic data quality assurance and monitoring mechanisms; therefore, the pilot census should test and evaluate their effectiveness. If the census monitoring dashboard is to be used, it needs to be in place and tested during the pilot census. The quality assurance mechanisms should also be tested, for example the supervisors’ re-interview module, field observations/monitoring mechanisms. See more about the census [monitoring dashboard](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/Chapter-06/Introduction).

### Census methodology and field operations

The pilot census should test the overall census methodology (including a census night and enumeration reference period). During the pilot census, an assessment of the adequacy of the planned duration of enumeration is done to ensure that adequate number of days are set aside for the exercise. There should be an assessment of the average duration that enumerators take to administer questionnaires to the different kinds of households and EAs to estimate the enumeration period, required human and financial resources. Field operations to assess may include EA opening and closing procedures, interactions between the supervisors and enumerators, engagement with the local administration, effectiveness of the publicity and advocacy activities. If a post-enumeration survey (PES) is planned as part of the census methodology, then a pilot PES should also be carried out. More about [PES](docs/experiences-lessons-2020/Chapter-14/Introduction).

### Adequacy of recruitment and training approach

It is critical to evaluate the caliber of personnel recruited to implement a digital census and the recruitment criteria must be piloted to avoid compromising data quality during enumeration. The pilot census should test and evaluate the recruitment approach to be deployed, the performance of the recruited personnel by cadre, the effectiveness of the training approach and adequacy of the training agenda. In addition, assess training venues on availability of IT infrastructure including adequate audio, video, and non-electronic tools (e.g., furniture) to facilitate presentation.

### Evaluate the overall census administrative, financial, and other general logistics structure

This entails an assessment of the various administrative structures such as the flow of information, transport arrangements, packaging of the census tools and equipment (tablets), issuance of the tablets and collection mechanisms, warehousing, flow and management of funds, documentation of the field processes, and replacement of tablets. This should also include an assessment of the risk mitigation strategy and updating it based on the evaluation of the pilot census findings as well as preparedness of regional offices for contingencies such as power outages, theft, or damage of IT equipment, procurement and other logistics like transport and storage.

### Test the census monitoring and evaluation plan

Do the dashboards provide census headquarters with the information that they need to keep stakeholders informed and to address issues e.g., if reallocation of workloads is required? Does the built-in error checking and routing on the CAPI devices work as expected? If a [post-enumeration survey pilot](docs/experiences-lessons-2020/Chapter-13/Introduction) is carried out then attempting to match the pilot census and pilot PES data is a great way to uncover systematic error in the data which may have been caused by issues with the questionnaire, the enumerator training or the transmission of data.
