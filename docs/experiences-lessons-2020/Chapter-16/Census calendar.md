### Census calendar

In conclusion, these challenges all point to the development of a census calendar which is a crucial step in the planning phase of a census. It serves as a guide to measure the progress of each stage of the census operation. It is designed to show the census activities, the amount of time required and in addition, show the sequence, interdependency, and timing of all the various steps in the census programme.

A check list of what is required to populate a census calendar has been developed based on the UNFPA Step-By-Step reference guide (Gant Chart) in combination with a typical country workplan used during the 2020 round of PHC.
