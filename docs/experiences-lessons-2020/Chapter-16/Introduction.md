## Introduction

At the eighth session of the Economic Commission for Africa Statistical Commission (STATCOM) for Africa held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 24–26 October 2022, it was noted that South-South cooperation was a good way for countries with experience with censuses to share their knowledge and experience with other countries from the 2020 round of censuses and to continue working with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and other partners to build collective knowledge that can be used as a resource during the 2030 round. It called on UNECA, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and other development partners to continue supporting countries in the implementation of the 2020 round of censuses and in preparation for the 2030 round.

In response to the 8th STATCOM recommendation, UNECA through the African Centre for Statistics (ACS) was given a core function of assisting countries in Africa to undertake a digital census with the aim of implementing modern data collection practices using new technology and methodologies.

During the 2020 census round, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) across the globe has changed how routine statistical business processes are being done. Therefore, a systematic planning approach needs be used to achieve the best intended gains from the population and housing census (PHC). The ACS, in strengthening innovative approaches by countries during the 2020 censuses, identified the need to streamline the census planning process to inform the 2030 census round.
