## Introduction  

Cartographic mapping is a major activity conducted during the pre-enumeration phase to create Enumeration Areas (EA). Such maps are used for work allocation during census enumeration and for dissemination of geospatial referenced census data. Therefore, the quality of maps used in the census has a major influence on the quality and reliability of census data collected.

The mapping process involves the following activities: proposal development, mobilization of resources, development of tools, acquisition of equipment, publicity, piloting, recruitment, training, data collection, map production and EA map verification.

Accurately delineated EAs are essential to a successful population and housing census as they form the basis for field allocation of enumerators. However, this process can be very costly. Digital technologies offer opportunities to utilize tools and resources to reduce this cost and produce more efficient EAs, such as high-resolution satellite imagery to support the cartographic mapping. However, these digital tools also create challenges regarding the quality of mapping and the integration of maps into collection devices and data collection software. Digital mapping and cartography can also greatly increase the digital data storage requirements for a census, which has additional cost implications.

NSOs across Africa may face greater challenges in their geospatial mapping than those in other parts of the world due to limitations in the coverage and timeliness of information collected by national geospatial information agencies, including the lack of address registers. Another challenge may be the inaccessibility of some areas to allow for the creation of EAs and collection of census data (see also [Alternative Approaches](file:///C:/Users/ymersha/Downloads/e-cencus-handbook/chapter2_to_upload.docx#_Alternative_Approaches)).

**Cartographic mapping during the non-digital vs digital era**

In the non-digital era, all the above activities were manually done on paper and were prone to human error and produced bulky papers for field teams to carry around.[\[RD1\]](file:///C:/Users/ymersha/Downloads/e-cencus-handbook/chapter2_to_upload.docx#_msocom_1)  This approach limits the ability to explore location data throughout the design and implementation of the census, including in dissemination, but it also limits the usefulness of collection data as this cannot be integrated with the geospatial. The time needed to standardize, print and distribute paper-based maps is very resource intensive, both in time and money, and it reduces the re-usability of cartographic assets for other statistical and operational activities carried out by the NSO.

Digital cartographic mapping has a wide range of benefits including better quality products, reduced costs, and reduced time for development of EA maps, increased accuracy, and improved consistency etc. _(Handbook on geographic information systems and digital mapping, pg. 10-13)._

Digital cartographic mapping involves the use of digital technology for:

*   map production which includes overlaying of spatial data collected in the field on satellite imageries/aerial photos, digitization of EA boundaries, preparation of EA maps
*   EA map verification and quality assurance of EA delineation through either high-resolution satellite imagery or field operations by cartographers
*   collecting spatial data (GPS coordinates for structures, households, features such as schools, hospitals, churches, etc.) from the field to be used in delineation of EAs
*   Integration of cartographic mapping and EA boundaries into digital mobile devices used by enumerators during the census collection operation
*   Integration of cartographic mapping into software monitoring collection progress during the census enumeration operation.
