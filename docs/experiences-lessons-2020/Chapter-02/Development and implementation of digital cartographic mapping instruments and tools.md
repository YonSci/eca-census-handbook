## Development and implementation of digital cartographic mapping instruments and tools

Among the tools developed for digital cartographic mapping there are various forms used for sensitization, field mapping activities, verification, instructions manuals, digitization schemas, map templates as well as map editing, map production and verification. In development and finalization of these tools and instruments, most countries benchmarked and got inputs and assistance from other countries that had undertaken digital census mapping. The cartographic tools should be able to assign a unique geographical coding and identification system to avoid any omissions.

**Defining geospatial products and the information collected**

It is important to define the attributes that will need to be collected as part of the digital cartographic mapping prior to commencing other activities relating to the geospatial aspects of census. This should be informed by what may be needed to inform the census enumeration operation (such as topographic or terrain features; the expected population density) or how statistics will be disaggregated in outputs. Knowing the intended output up-front guides the choice of the best application and the questions to use in capturing data.

The digital tools used to produce maps and to collect geospatial data, and how these integrate into other digital architecture used by the NSO for census and the budget for carrying out mapping activities should also factor into how these attributes are defined.

Prioritization of the most important cartographic features is important for ensuring the scale of the digital mapping undertaken does not get too great. The inclusion of many stakeholder requests risks changing the project from a typical cartographic exercise to a statistical undertaking. This potentially slows down the mapping exercise and affects the entire timing of the census activities.

**Pilot mapping**

Pilot mapping is recommended to test the preparedness to undertake the main cartographic mapping process. The aim is to test the validity and reliability of methodology, tools, and equipment to be used in the main cartographic mapping process. The findings from the pilot inform the finalization of tools, instruments, and methodology. The pilot mapping process entails testing the suitability of the tools, logistical arrangements, assessing the workload, providing a basis for NSOs to mobilize resources and plan for an effective implementation of the process to ensure quality data is obtained.

While planning for a digital cartographic mapping pilot, it is important to consider the terrain, type of settlement patterns (urban, rural, hard to reach, arid and semi-arid lands) to enable effective testing of processes. See also [Census Testing and Pilots](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/Chapter-05/Introduction).

Using base maps or cartographic resources already available can assist this process. Working with geospatial authorities in the country to adopt best practice for tools and methods can also help with reducing the cost of pilot and field operation activities while not compromising on the quality. Where newer technologies and resources are being integrated into cartographic activities, such as the use of satellite imagery, pilot mapping should include some testing of the quality of outputs and if these meet assumptions regarding the production of EAs and other geospatial content.

**Publicity and advocacy for cartographic mapping**

Publicity and advocacy for cartographic mapping is done to create awareness of the activity and seek support for the main cartographic mapping and census enumeration. During publicity NSOs seek collaboration, support, involvement, and ownership of the grassroot stakeholders and local leadership. The roles and responsibilities of all the stakeholders are also established. See also [Advocacy, Publicity and Resource Mobilization](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/Chapter-12/Introduction).

**Field data collection for cartographic mapping**

Field data collection for digital cartographic mapping entails use of mobile technology to collect spatial data (GPS coordinates for structures, households, features such as schools, hospitals, churches, etc.) to be used in delineation of EAs. Most countries embraced the use of mobile technology to capture the spatial data and transmit it to the central servers for map production.

**Map production**

After the mapping data is collected and sent to the central servers, a team of GIS technicians are engaged to undertake digitization of the EAs (EA map production). During map production, the census geo-file is developed to be used during provisioning of tablets, enumeration, and geospatial data analysis. 

Map production is implemented in two stages.

**Stage 1:** Digitization of village boundaries; delineation of EAs from village polygons; creation of the EA attribute data (geography File- geo-file); preparation of EA maps (map compilation) and printing of hard copy maps for editing and verification.

**Stage 2:** Effecting changes from field verification; updating the geo-file; preparation of the final EA map (PDF format); printing of final maps for enumeration.

Delineation of EAs should consider the distance and number of households to be covered by the enumerator within the stipulated census enumeration period.

**EA Map verification**

EA map verification is the process of undertaking field verification of the boundaries of the created EAs by the local administration before the maps are finalized for census enumeration. At the end of the delineation process, it is necessary to assess the accuracy of the maps, completeness of the mapping, household size and to verify EA boundaries. EA map verification is therefore aimed at reducing the EA boundary errors before the maps can be used. The verification process provides an opportunity to review, inspect, check, audit, establish and document whether EA maps reflected the actual situation on the ground.
