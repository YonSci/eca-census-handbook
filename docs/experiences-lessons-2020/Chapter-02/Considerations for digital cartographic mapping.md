## Considerations for digital cartographic mapping

Transitioning to fully digital cartographic mapping for census requires NSOs to consider a number of factors and potential risks. It is first important to ensure that adequate Geographic Information System (GIS) infrastructure is in place. This includes: 

*   A clear specification for the geospatial and cartographic data deliverable from the mapping activities, including the geospatial layers, feature representation and GIS model.
*   Agreed access to the appropriate tools to carry out the digital cartographic mapping activity to the required precision, such as handheld devices equipped with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning technology, and/or a supply of licensed or open-source satellite imagery.
*   Appropriate and up-to-date GIS software.
*   Adequate digital storage and processing power to undertake the required digital cartographic mapping activities. This can either be on-premise servers or cloud-based infrastructure. 
*   Well-trained and skilled human resources as detailed on page 35 of the [Handbook on Geospatial Infrastructure in Support of Census Activities](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/handbooks/Series_F103en.pdf).
*   A clear understanding of how digital cartographic mapping software will integrate with the chosen census data collection devices (such as the functionality and storage limitations of tablets), and the data collection software being used for the census (such as CSPro or ArcGIS Survey123).
*   A well-defined and sustainable census geography that can be digitised and seamlessly integrated into future successive censuses.

During the 2020 round of PHC, most African countries embraced digital cartographic mapping. Some countries conducted purely digital cartographic mapping where mobile devices and remote sensing products were used, while others embraced hybrid digital cartographic mapping. 

This chapter points out selected country experiences, lessons learned and recommendations on what should be done during digital cartographic mapping. Areas covered include developing the proposal, pilot testing, publicity and advocacy, data collection, production, and verification of maps and issues regarding the mapping personnel.
