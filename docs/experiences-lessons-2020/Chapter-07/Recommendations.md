## Recommendations

- Countries are encouraged to use a high-speed bandwidth that is not internet dependent considering that multiple tablets are connected to the network simultaneously during provisioning of tablets to minimize costs as was the case in Kenya.

- The mobile device management software should be procured well on time to avoid last-minute device enrollment because without device enrolment, it is not possible to manage or install Apps in the devices and this delays the entire process.

- Unique identification for the tablets should be based on geocodes. This is key because batching of tablets should be done down to the sublocation level for easy tracking and allocation as was the case in Kenya and Botswana.

- Prioritize investments in digital infrastructure and tools to support efficient and high-quality field operations and logistics.

- Develop comprehensive training programs to ensure that all field personnel are proficient in the use of digital technologies.

- Set up a support center at the headquarters of the census implementing agency, staffed by employees who have been well trained on the questionnaire content and have ICT. Provision of efficient support center equipment such as laptops, phones, desks, and seats.Â 

- The census call center should have a clear work cycle with an ICT incident Management System whereby problems and inquiries are received from the enumerator or supervisor during enumeration and the call Centre Agent sends the case to field or headquarters technical support team and an update should be provided as to whether the case has been resolved.

- Include the monitoring dashboard at the time of training of field staff so that its essence is made known at that stage. As a result, the data collecting exercise will function better as field staff are aware that their performance is continually being evaluated in relation to targets.
