## Selected Country Experience


**Botswana** employed the Manage Engine Mobile Device Manager Plus (MDM) application to remotely manage census devices. This tool offered a comprehensive suite of features including device enrolment, app management, remote troubleshooting, security enforcement, location tracking, and audit reporting. A virtual server was set up to support the MDM system, and IT officers were granted access to log in using domain credentials. They also used Zoho Assist for remote support. This setup allowed for real-time monitoring, inventory tracking, and secure data wiping in case of device loss or theft, enhancing both operational efficiency and data security.

**Tanzania** developed an innovative backup data collection system using enumerators’ personal Android devices. A custom Android container was created to temporarily lock personal devices for census use, ensuring secure data collection and synchronization with census servers. Although this solution was not deployed during the actual enumeration, pilot testing showed it to be a viable contingency option. Further testing is recommended to refine the tool for broader use, especially in resource-constrained or emergency scenarios.

**Tanzania**

Tanzania developed an alternative back-up means for data collection using enumerator-owned devices. Tanzania developed a custom Android container that could be installed on enumerators’ personal mobile devices. This provided a backup solution in case of mass failure of census tablets. The Android container locked the mobile device for census use only for a specified period. Data was securely synced to the census servers. The pilot was successful and demonstrated the feasibility of using personal devices as a backup. The container secured the device and ensured data was synced securely to servers. The tool wasn't used in the actual enumeration, so real-world challenges weren't fully explored, however, Tanzania would use this approach again as a contingency in case of mass failure of census tablets.
