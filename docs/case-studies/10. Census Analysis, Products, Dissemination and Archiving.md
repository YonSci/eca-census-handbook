# Chapter 10: Census Analysis, Products, Dissemination and Archiving

**Kenya**

Several products were to be generated from 2019 Kenya population and housing census (KPHC) meeting different user needs. They included: Preliminary report (Volume I), Basic volumes (Volumes I-IV), census data bases, cartographic maps, geodatabase that includes Enumeration Areas (EAs)-development of HH master sample frames, census thematic maps (population atlas), analytical/thematic reports (which are based on studies of demographic, social and economic topics, government priority as well as some methodological issues), posters, leaflets, wall charts and brochures. 
The first set of the four basic census results were released within six months after the enumeration: Volume I: Distribution of the enumerated population by size, sex, number of households and average household size, at national, county and sub-county levels within two months - November, 2019; Volume II: Distribution of Population by Administrative units (up to sub-locational level-lowest administrative unit);  Volume III: Distribution of Population by Age, Sex and County; and Volume IV: Distribution of Population by Socio-Economic Characteristics. 
Analytical Reports (Monographs) that were launched two years after enumeration (included: Fertility and Nuptiality: Levels, trends, and differentials in Fertility and Nuptiality; Mortality and Health: Levels, trends and patterns in mortality and health; Migration: Levels, trends and patterns in internal and international migration; Urbanisation: Levels, trends and patterns of urbanisation with a view of providing useful data for formulating appropriate and sustainable policies on urbanisation; Household and Family Dynamics; Gender Dimension: provides gender differentials/gaps in various indicators; Disability: Levels and differentials in disability status; Youths and Adolescents: demographic profiles, education levels, fertility levels, employment status, disability, and ICT usage concerning the youth and adolescents; The older and vulnerable population: situation of vulnerable segments of population in Kenya (the elderly-age 60+; orphans; working children (5-17); children in child-headed household (HH 18 years; persons who declared themselves as intersex etc.); Education and Training: School attendance status, education enrolment and attainment, training acquired and qualified for;  Housing conditions, amenities and household assets; ICT: use and ownership of  ICT equipment;. 
Others that were launched included: Population Projections: Projections for 2020–2045, Labour Force Dynamics: Economic characteristics of the population; Agriculture; Population Dynamics; Census Atlas; Geospatial Dissemination System; 209 KPHC Popular Report; Administrative Report.

The process of producing the 209 census products started with identification of a technical team drawn from the KPHC Technical Working Committee (TWC) and those with experience from the 2009 census to lead the process. 
A concept note to undertake the development of outputs was developed and the required technical assistance was sourced from universities and government ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs), while the financial support was obtained from various development partners. During implementation of the process, mapping of the users and key stakeholders by thematic area/sector and formation of teams by thematic areas; Identifying the key indicators by thematic area taking into consideration both international, regional and national indicators; Development of tabulation plans per thematic area and report formats which were presented to the TWC for discussion and approval; and the team took lead in all the phases of production of census products. 
During development of the census products, the following steps were followed: 
1) Development of tabulation plans for various indicators
2) Generation of tables for the various indicators
3) Undertaking consistence checks based on the outputs from various tables
4) Review of the data edit specifications to address any noted inconsistencies
5) Generation of final tables from cleaned data set
6) Report writing and peer review of the reports
7) Editing and formatting of the reports
8) Validation of the reports through engagement of various stakeholders
9) Printing of the final report
10) Launch of the reports

In Kenya, dissemination involved packaging, distributing, and making available census results in the most effective manner, as well as encouraging wide usage of the data. Data dissemination processes were guided by the dissemination policy which addressed the principles, conditions, technical aspects, and the way Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) disseminates statistics to users for research and other purposes. 

The dissemination process utilised included: public launch of the census results; publishing basic reports and monographs from the census data; organizing media forums to share the results; holding national and county dissemination workshops; posting results on KNBS website and data portal; production of digital storage media- DVDs, CDs and USB drives; participating in public platforms for exhibitions e.g. Agricultural Society of Kenya shows; library – the KNBS library stores publications as reference materials for researchers and the general public; use of social media—twitter, YouTube,  Facebook handle to share key highlights; engagement of the media through media workshop briefs/breakfast meeting briefs; TV and Radio to share the key highlights. 

KNBS tried to involve all stakeholders in census data dissemination planning, especially engagement with the Office of the President to give releases legitimacy and wider coverage. It is important to encourage structures that allow the engagement of key stakeholders from the start of the census process. KNBS was obliged to release census data or grant access to the data when it is satisfied that all reasonable steps have been considered to safeguard confidentiality of the respondents, taking into consideration: the country’s legal framework on freedom of information, data protection, and ethical considerations, and KNBS shares data/information to individuals or institutions after official release. Kenya was faced with inadequate resources to undertake disseminations to the lower, sub-national levels.

**Ghana**

-	Volume 6: Census Atlas - The 2021 PHC atlas will present information on socio-demographic, economic and housing characteristics in maps at the regional and district levels. 
Other products yet to be produced include plans to present statistics in interactive and user-friendly ways to promote usage of the data through the following mediums: policy briefs, interactive census results dashboard, infographics, dissemination seminars, webinars for data users, videos, 10% Public Use Microdata Sample.


**Malawi**

Malawi completed their digital census in 2018. The National Statistics Office (NSO) produced print and digital products. Some of the products included: Census Preliminary Report, district reports - 28 districts and 4 cities, thematic reports (17 types), political constituency reports, press releases, magazine and newspaper inserts, media and policy briefs, data wheels, census posters A1, A3, A5, roll-up banners, journal paper - https://content.iospress.com/download/statistical-journal-of-the-iaos/sji190587?id=statistical-journal-of-the-iaos%2Fsji190587. 
The website contains links to the main census report, thematic reports, statistical tables, and Smart Census Application. The census products are also disseminated in the Malawi Data Dissemination Platform (MDDP). It has helped with the enhancing/expanding of; easily accessible digital dissemination of statistics through innovation, support data analysis and dissemination of census reports, widen data literacy and usage. MDDP offers: statistical tables, thematic maps, platform with flexible search functionality that allows extraction of data: to make comparisons, to yield insights into various aspects of Malawi’s social, spatial, and economic conditions, to create infographics for better understanding, and to make independent data analysis. A demonstration on how the platform is used was made.


Malawi developed a monitoring and evaluation and crisis recovery plans for 2018 census. A dissemination plan was proposed and developed by the NSO publicity team that set out specific objectives and expected outputs, brainstormed on theoretical framework and strategies, compiled/documented the proposed approaches and activities, planned the resources (communication channels, budget, human resources, etc.), developed timelines for realistic completion of the tasks/activities, devised a crisis recovery plan - performed a risk analysis and identified possible “plan Bs”, and monitoring and evaluation plan.

The dissemination plan was placed within the broader communication strategy of the 2018 Malawi, regular consultation/bouncing with the PHC Communication strategy was carried out, audience analysis/segmentation was done to identify key audiences, message identification, products design and medium/channel for reaching out to propose dissemination products, research and brainstorm on dissemination strategies/approaches, document/develop dissemination approaches. Among the approaches used was mass communication. 
- One of the successful approaches for reaching out to masses adopted to publicise census products and results through: radio and TV programs, press releases, newspaper inserts, street banners, roll-up banners, NSO website and data dissemination platform, distribution - libraries, universities, district councils/city assemblies, distributed census results through memory cards – easy sharing. 
-The second approach was: interpersonal communication – planned working sessions, data literacy engagements with various groups including Members of Parliament, NGOs, CSOs, NSS/Line Ministries etc., social media - for updates and reminders: Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp 
-The third approach included: partnerships which included involvement of other organisations/institutions, building third-party and celebrity endorsements who carried along the messages from census, NSO website link on UNFPA-Malawi webpage, advocacy/promotion activities which included making presentations during meetings, panel discussions on census results during events (e.g. launch of data dissemination platform)
Malawi was faced with a challenge of including unplanned costs to cover Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) and high professional fees to engage communication experts.

**Mozambique**

From the 2017 census, the following products were produced: Preliminary and final Report (selected table), brochure of national and provincial summary results, projection at national and provincial level,shape file and geographic codes, REDATAM, PxWeb, 10% public use micro data simply. Other products included: atlas for children and general, infantile brochure, comics for teenagers and youth, informative board on roads and borders.
Eswatini
Thematic reports and population projections reports were produced but the Launch of thematic reports was delayed by two years because there was a shortage of staff to undertake data cleaning. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) provided a census technical specialist who was stationed within the NSO, and managed the production of census products. 
The process of developing census products entailed the involvement of subject area specialists from within and outside of government (NSO personnel including the GIS Unit, health, education, the UN and others). So far, they have produced a series of thematic reports packaged in ten publications.
Tanzania
The Initial Census Results was launched by the President of the United Republic of Tanzania on 31 October 2022, 45 days after completion of enumeration. During the launch, the president also launched the National Guideline for Utilisation of Census Results. This is the first time Tanzania had such a guideline. The main goal of the Guideline was to increase understanding, transparency and expand the scope of the utilisation of the 2022 PHC Results for the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania and the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar, Citizens, and all stakeholders in inclusive planning for sustainable social development, economic and the environment.

In Tanzania, several dissemination platforms were used including:
i. Traditional Media: newspapers (printed and online), press releases, television and radio broadcasts
ii.Digital Platforms: social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter), interactive databases, geographic products (map books, ATLAS), E-Government portals, mobile technology (SMS)
iii. Web Dissemination: National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and The Office of the Chief Government Statistician (OCGS) Zanzibar websites, online data access platforms e.g., Tanzania census app for dissemination (this can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or App Store)

Other Approaches: public dissemination events, workshops and training sessions based on the dissemination strategy, thematic workshops (this is planned to be conducted after the release of thematic reports).
 
In implementing the Guideline for Utilisation of Census Results, which identifies various groups that should be provided with the census results for planning and assessing various programs implemented by the government and stakeholders, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has developed a strategy to disseminate the results to different government leaders and other relevant stakeholders. 
The first census product was the Initial Results Publication, which was mainly developed by census technical team. Other products that include the Administrative Units Population Distribution Reports, Age and Sex Distribution Reports, The Tanzania Basic Demographic and Socio-Economic Profile and Constituency Population Distribution Reports were developed in collaboration of NBS/OCGS staff and other members from ministries, higher learning institutions and retired staff. Currently the Government is finalizing the Regional Basic Demographic and Socio-Economic Profile Reports which are also developed in the same manner.
There is a plan of contracting experts from the universities to write Monographs, however through development of these reports, staff from NBS and OCGS and interns from universities will be involved to build capacity.

**Egypt**

The 2017 census results were published via a platform on the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS) website. The platform disseminates the data from their census. CAPMAS set up a Geoportal for GIS data from the census. It used Google Analytics to monitor who are using their Census products. CAPMAS issues an annual schedule of publications, bulletins, indicators, statistical data, they are released and disseminated using various tools that include hard copy publications, soft copy on CD, press statements, press releases, workshops & conferences, fax and flyers. 

CAPMAS was eager to provide users with the updated data upon their completion, so priority was given to the electronic publication of the preliminary results of the census until the results were published on the official website of CAPMAS. Website analysis was done using Google Analytics specifically the usage of Google Analytics on the website analysis such as wherefrom (users’ login, total of users, their category such as: country, language, and detailed data page on views).

**Zimbabwe**

Zimbabwe produced eight preliminary reports on a modular basis to provide quick feedback to the 2022 PHC users. Data on census preliminary reports was supposed to be used during 2023 National budget preparation and delimitation of constituency boundaries. Hybrid dissemination workshops were held both physically and virtually using Zoom and Team platforms. Subject matter discussions were also held. The census results were also presented at two Cabinet meetings. The reports were also uploaded on the website www.zimstat.co.zw and a census page on the Open Data Portal (ODP) was created. Social media was used such as: live streaming of presentation of results on Facebook (ZIMSTAT), Twitter posts and updates (@zimstat), WhatsApp, electronic and print media: invited journalists to attend dissemination workshops, interviews held in local languages Shona and Ndebele, various infographics.  Some products generated included Census National Report, ten Census Provincial Profile Reports, Vital Statistics Report from 2022 PHC data, 16 Census Thematic Reports building on 2012 experience, Census Atlas, and thematic maps. 
The following dissemination methods will be used for the outstanding products: posters, leaflets, wall charts, population datasheets, flyers and brochures will be produced and distributed in all the provinces and districts, round table discussions and seminars for thematic reports, and media briefs, media releases and fact sheets for all the products. To allow for greater access, the 2022 PHC dataset will be added onto the REDATAM-based census database systems which are currently uploaded onto the ZIMSTAT website (www.zimstat.co.zw). This will allow users to generate user-defined tables, graphs and maps using the 2022 PHC data. Statistical awareness and educational programs on the ways to access, interpret and use census information will be done for effective outreach. Partnerships with the media to improve the wider dissemination and understanding of statistical information from census.

**Mozambique**

Mozambique engaged various stakeholders (political parties, ministries, medias, NGOs, donors, etc.) from questionnaire development stage to dissemination stage. A dissemination plan was elaborated and implemented in accordance with stakeholders’ segmentation in which they grouped the users into various groups, identified the purpose for which they use the statistics produced, and the format that would be most useful to a given group. 
The groups included: universities (students/professors) and researchers, development cooperation agencies, donors, international NGOs, and the United Nations, children and teenagers, entrepreneurs, banks, and private sector, government, media, politicians, statistics producers (National Institute of Statistics (INE), Bank of Mozambique, national statistical system (SEN) members), people with special needs / people with disabilities, general public (using an inclusive methodology), civil society, NGOs and religious institutions. INE mapped suitable formats for each user group and designed a product for each segment, including school children (e.g. comics for the youth). 
In the last census (2007) the thematic studies were written by NSO staff in collaboration with local universities. Differently, with 2017 census the approach was to use consultants. This imposed challenge on data use by consultants that require deep involvement of INE staff.  When users are involved, making data available, explaining how to use and interpret the data, they respond positively, (for example, the NSO stabilised a partnership with media association, reining the media and stabilising flexible communication channels such as WhatsApp, NSO created journalistic award. In response, all media refer to the NSO when talking about statistics, they constantly request for data and clarifications in the WhatsApp group, they publish something weekly about statistics, and the average visits increased from 171,207 (2017 and 2018) to  288,721 (2020 and 2021).

**Eswatini** 

The first census in Swaziland was conducted in 1956 and since then, following the United Nations recommendations, the government has kept up to the ten years schedule. The last census to be conducted was in 2017 census. The census preliminary report was published within four months (September 2017) after enumeration, the thematic reports were done after 30 months (December 2019) after enumeration, and the population projections were done in August 2020 (more than 3 years). These reports were printed and availed in soft copy on USB flash drives, and on the Central Statistics Office and Government website. Each report was disseminated as soon as they were published, through stakeholder workshops and electronically for individual user requests.
