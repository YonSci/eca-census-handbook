**Statistics Sierra Leone**

Several stakeholders were involved to build public trust in every step of the way namely: Engaged CSOs for Mid-Term Census (National Elections Watch(NEW),Institute for Governance Reforms(IGR), Native Consortium, Accountability Sierra Leone, Heal Sierra Leone, Health for All Coalition etc); engaged Parliamentary Oversight Committee on Population to help in publicity, Members of Publicity Committee  also did media engagements on behalf of NSOs, All Political Parties Association of Sierra Leone (APPA) also joined them in Publicity, Nation Wide Stakeholders Engagement via town hall meetings in all districts of Sierra Leone. All Critical Voices (CSOs, Press, Political Parties) etc. were given an opportunity to monitor both the census and cartographic mapping. Those engaged included district council chairperson’s/mayors, MDAs, Youth Groups, Women's Group, Paramount Chiefs etc.

During preparation of the mid-term census, publicity was stepped up by creating new communication content that required signing of MOUs with Media Houses that translated into census hour, media engagement on flagship radio/TV Programs, as well as social media hypes & content creation for digital communication such as Websites.

New key messages were created to increase awareness about the census, educate the public about the census benefits (to them and the country), Remind them about their legal obligation and duty to take part in the census, explained to them WHAT to do, WHEN and HOW communities will be enumerated including dates, duration, ways of data collection, target population, etc. Special messages were prepared for the resistant communities e.g., _‘’If you don’t allow to be counted, you stand the risk of your communities not being planned for’’_\-This helped a lot to ease the resistance.

Several channels were used such as printed MTPHC Banners and deployed them across Sierra Leone, engaged Town criers with handheld megaphones, printed MTPHC T-Shirts/Wristbands/ Posters, established Census Toll Free Helpline (881) in Partnership with Telcos who sent census bulk SMSs to their customers, they brought on board CSOs/Brand influencers/ambassadors to support in the engagements.

The key tools used were:  Media Engagement (Stats SL Hour-Radio and TV, Simulcast (40  Radio Stations) Country Wide, Simulcast (4 Television Stations) Country Wide, Newspaper publications –Hypes etc, Mid-Term Census countdown Screen tag/pop up on TV stations, Press Briefings, Digital Communication(Social Media & Website)); Sensitization**(**Meetings (Regional and District), Jingles (Different Languages), TVC and Short videos, Door to Door Announcements with Megaphones ( District and National), Public Announcement(Loud Hailer Vehicles), Census Billboards, Banners, Posters, Census Theme Song (English & Krio)).

**Tanzania**

The 2022 PHC used intensive and extensive publicity and advocacy programmes to educate, sensitize and mobilize the people to participate in the census process. In Tanzania, most people were sensitized and motivated to participate in census enumeration in such a way they were calling at the office within the enumeration time asking for the enumerator to visit their households.

  
The Census Logo and Slogan remained the same as those of the 2012 census: “SENSA KWA MAENDELEO: JIANDAE KUHESABIWA” that is “CENSUS FOR DEVELOPMENT: PREPARE TO BE COUNTED”. There were two Census Commissioners one for Tanzania Mainland and the other for Tanzania Zanzibar. The main function of the Commissioners was to publicize the implementation of the Population and Housing Census and Advocacy activities. To standardize publicity and advocacy campaigns throughout the country, the NBS and OCGS developed publicity guidelines that were used during the Census publicity and advocacy operations. The guidelines explained in brief, the meaning and purpose of the Census as well as broad topics covered.

One month before the Enumeration Day, an intensified mass media campaign known as SENSABIKA \[Be counted\] coordinated by the Ministry of Culture, Arts & Sports was launched. The campaign helped to mobilize the entire country to participate in the census enumeration. Massive SMS campaign (daily messages) reaching about 45 million mobile subscribers daily and other social media campaigns were also intensified in this period.

There was high level of political will as:

- The President of the United Republic of Tanzania Her Excellence Samia Suluhu Hassan declared the census date and launched the census logo in April 2022. The launch was held officially and involved various media. This event motivated all citizens to participate in the 2022 PHC

- After the President declared the census date, the Census Logo was printed for distribution throughout the country. The Logo was printed in newspapers, stickers, leaflets, wheel covers, flags and envelopes. Stickers with the logo were placed at strategic places, including public service vehicles and public notice boards in order to inform and educate the public about the census process and date.

- On the census night that is the of night of 22nd /23rd August 2022, the President addressed the nation, her speech was broadcasted in all televisions and various radio stations. SMS from the President urging the public to participate and wishing them a successful enumeration were distributed. There was also special night program (Fireworks) on in six major cities (Dar es Salaam, Mwanza, Arusha, Dodoma, Mbeya and Tanga) just before Enumeration started (12:00 midnight) to attract the public attention.  The President of the United Republic of Tanzania and the President of Zanzibar were enumerated early on the first day of the census enumeration period and soon after enumeration they addressed the nation to create awareness and raise publicity.

- The initial Census Results was launched by the President of the United Republic of Tanzania in public.

In terms of resource mobilization, the Census Stakeholders Committee, which comprises the development partners and chaired by the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, was established to undertake resources mobilization for the census’s activities. The Central Census Committee co-chaired by the Prime Minister and the Second Vice President, Zanzibar provided general guidelines and mobilized the required resources. The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania financed the 2022 PHC by 97% the 3% was from the Development Partners.

**Namibia**

Namibia developed a communication plan focusing on advocacy and publicity of the census mapping project at national level. The most convenient method used was the distribution of flyers and distribution and displaying of posters to create awareness. During this project, the RS were able to engage community leaders through meetings and had the opportunity to elaborate on the objectives of the census mapping. Mobilization was done in each selected EA before commencement of data collection exercises to ensure that local people were aware of the project and what was expected of them.

Courtesy visits to the constituency and local councilors were also undertaken to introduce the Census Mapping Project and its components as well as to request for their assistance in informing their constituency inhabitants about the Census Mapping Project during their respective radio announcements and community meetings. In addition, FM Radio announcements complimented by newspaper articles and newspaper advertisements were also placed in local newspapers to inform the public about the Census Mapping Project and its approach. Television strips were run on NBC-TV before the News Bulletin and specific talk shows such as Good Morning Namibia and Business Today to announce the commencement of fieldwork.

**Kenya**

Kenya developed a publicity and advocacy strategic plan and established a respective sub-committee. A communications firm was engaged to implement the Publicity and Advocacy strategy and address any other publicity and advocacy issues during the 2019 KPHC. In Kenya, the firm was able to segment various groups and arrange for sensitization workshops with specific messages developed for them. The target audiences and their intended outcome of interventions were identified as follows:
