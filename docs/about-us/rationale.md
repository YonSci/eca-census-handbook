## Rationale 

The e-census handbook draws its content from experiences of National Statistical Offices (NSO), Pan-African Agencies and census experts supporting implementation of PHC in Africa during the 2020 Round of PHC. The information is provided voluntarily by the various stakeholders, reviewed, and published in the handbook for reference especially with the countries planning to undertake a PHC and informing planning for the 2030 Round of PHC in Africa. It is a ‘living’ document – it will grow to accommodate new experiences, as more NSOs undertake and evaluate their own digital censuses.
