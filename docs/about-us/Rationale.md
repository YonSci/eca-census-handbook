## Rationale

The e-census handbook draws its content from experiences of NSOs, Pan-African Agencies and census experts supporting the implementation of PHCs in Africa during the 2020 round of PHCs. The information is provided voluntarily by the various stakeholders, reviewed, and published in the handbook for reference especially with the countries planning to undertake a PHC and informing planning for the 2030 round of PHCs in Africa. It is a ‘living’ document – it will grow to accommodate new experiences, as more NSOs undertake and evaluate their own digital censuses.
