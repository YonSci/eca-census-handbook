## Purpose


The e-census handbook provides a repository of experiences, key lessons learned and good practices in planning and implementation of digital censuses in Africa during the 2020 round of PHCs. It enables National Statistics Offices (NSOs) and other partners to have exposure to experiences from across Africa and apply these to their own census planning and design context.

More specifically, the e-census handbook:

        1. Presents the experiences and lessons learned in the implementation of preparatory activities for a digital PHC in Africa.
        2. Provides experiences in acquiring and using electronic devices in digital PHC undertaking.
        3. Gives the key lessons, issues and how the use of electronic devices and other technologies (e.g., e-recruitment) impacts the census business process model. 
        4. Highlights areas of country expertise that could potentially be called upon in the future to provide technical assistance to African countries as part of their census development. 
        5. Informs planning for the 2030 African round of PHCs through the identification of key areas where work at the regional level is required to support the planning and implementation of censuses.
